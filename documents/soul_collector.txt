TODO:

-> add sounds and hud elements to soul_collector level up ( and soul collection )

-> add cheat code for skipping soul_collector_levels

-> add clientcommands for toggle-able abilities

-> fly/swim check for rodeo controls ( and default DropHost )
	--> and default drop-host/return-rodeo/end-pain transition move

-> develop proper third person chasecam (note: the client is the human view, the player is the entity being moved around)

___________________________________________________________
TESTING:

-> husk holds a weapon (ideally that looks like the players current weapon)...meh ( stuck on super shotgun...but works in coop...WHAT? )
	--> REASONING: the player doesn't have a per-weapon worldmodel in first person

BUG: not all soldier souls make a sound when picked up ???

BUG: the player does not appear translucent ( nor does the husk, which is correct ) --> tested in coop SOLUTION: change effect?

BUG: fix the clip into walls/ceilings when the host dies

BUG: host PITCH changes too much --> solution: clamp the v_angle OR proper chasecam may resolve the issue

BUG: ducks TOO MUCH/REPEATEDLY ... right into floors if duck, then duck-shoot ( bbox lowerd, then again )
	// specifically write a new duck move (if the monster has the animations )
	// set an array, make a callback to it, declare in possessed.h
	// check if the host is already ducked/standing before performing the move/transition

add a boolean flag for player in "ghost mode"

add a boolean flag for player in "host mode"

add a boolean flag for enemy "possesed" (supplant think commands)

HOST MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> leave inhabited enemy (instead of going to player).
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> explode/gib inhabited enemy.

GHOST MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> inhabit the nearest enemy.
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> return to player.

NORMAL MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> nothing.
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> spawn a 3rd person ghost entity that flies in control of the player (still collides with walls).

"uberhost" [ eg 'v' ] -> toggle between uberhost and rodeo host controls
___________________________________________________________

f = "ghost"
r = "inhabit"
v = "uberhost"
y = "rip_souls"

o = "drain_life"
n = "detect_life"
m = "ghost_fly"

F7 = "soul_abilities"
F8 = "soul_collection"

cheatcode: soullevel [1-5] ( default displays usage )

______________________________________________

EXTRA:

->allow host persistance between levels ( free and reset the husk near the new player spawn point, OR obliterate the host and "teleport" the "husk" to that origin )
