TODO:

-> change soulshiled to a no-model entity with an effect**********

-> make it a COMPETITIVE co-op game: you kill eachothers bodies/husks with monsters for FRAGS, first to 20 wins
	--> single player => start at level 1 / multi-player => start at level 5 ???
	--> frags hud element
	--> spawn in ANY area of a level ( allow teleport to area w/clients if in an empty one )
	--> how does Q2 handle coop area/level change???
	--> co-op DM start as far away from other clients as possible ( within an area ) ( use monster spawnpoints )
	--> flesh out other uberhosts
	--> definitly no normal weapons ever
	--> make non-ghost clients that approach each other get pushed back and svc_temp_entity an explostion in-between ( no touching )
	--> check win-condition and end game
	

-> give drain life a shell in 3rd person ( so its obvious )

-> test co-op for ent visible ( hud stuff, ghost stuff ), and if only the user can see the detect-life lines

-> fly/swim check for rodeo controls ( and default DropHost, and follower stuff )

-> develop proper third person chasecam (note: the client is the human view, the player is the entity being moved around)

--> make installation README ( not a batch )

-> husk holds a weapon (ideally that looks like the players current weapon)...meh ( stuck on super shotgun...but works in coop...WHAT? )
	--> REASONING: the player doesn't have a per-weapon worldmodel in first person

BUG(?): changing areas/levels with an active follower crash ???

*BUG: soul abilities and collection NOT PERSISTANT between levels (fix that)

*BUG: soul abilities etc not SAVED ( in save.c )

*BUG(1of2): getRidOfWeapon ==> gunindex = 0 still allows firing ( yet newweapon = NULL crashes ) => replace weaponthink qualifiers (ghostmode, hostmode)

*BUG(2of2): if a husk is active between scenes/levels then notarget remains active despite ghostmode deactiveating and husk disappearing
	-> flags get saved into savedFlags in PERSISTANT DATA
	-> solution: actively clear the husk between scenes

*BUG: the player does not appear translucent ( nor does the husk, which is correct ) --> tested in coop SOLUTION: change effect?

*BUG: fix the clip into walls/ceilings when the host dies

BUG: crash between hello and giving an order and the new follower dies
	--> replicate by having current follower attack a monster, 
		be in its death throws,
		and shoot at a monster player just said hi to ( killing it )
	--> possibly fixed in monster_think ( double checked monster has an owner before ref. owner->client )

BUG: weird angles on detect_life in hover hostmode ( disable, or wait until better chasecam )

BUG: spawnsoul noise randomly repeats until interrupted post-soul-spawn ( even plays over the console dropdown when other sounds dont )

BUG: host PITCH changes too much --> solution: clamp the v_angle OR proper chasecam may resolve the issue

BUG: ducks TOO MUCH/REPEATEDLY ... right into floors if duck, then duck-shoot ( bbox lowerd, then again )
	// specifically write a new duck move (if the monster has the animations )
	// set an array, make a callback to it, declare in possessed.h
	// check if the host is already ducked/standing before performing the move/transition

EXTRA:

->allow host persistance between levels/areas 
	--> spawn a husk near the new player spawn point
	--> spawn same class as old host and TakeHost
	--> only when able to warp_husk at higher levels
