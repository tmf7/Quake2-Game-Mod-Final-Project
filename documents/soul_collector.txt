TODO:

->player can only pickup dropped dead enemy souls

->develop proper third person chasecam (note: the client is the human view, the player is the entity being moved around)

___________________________________________________________
TESTING:

husk holds a weapon (ideally that looks like the players current weapon)...meh (stuck on super shotgun)


BUG: idle animation -->too fast

BUG: fix the clip into walls/ceilings when the host dies

BUG: whether the v_angles sync up seems random? needs further testing ( seems okay 4/13/16 5pm )

BUG: doesn't duck ( as expected because player isn't on ground to begin with )

BUG**: continues repeating pain animation? YES, probably BECAUSE its self->possessed

POTENTIAL BUG: there may be a syncronization issue ( null/empty pointer useage ) when transferring for death/pain

____________________________________________________________


add a boolean flag for player in "ghost mode"

add a boolean flag for player in "host mode"

add a boolean flag for enemy "possesed" (supplant think commands)

HOST MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> leave inhabited enemy (instead of going to player).
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> explode/gib inhabited enemy.

GHOST MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> inhabit the nearest enemy.
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> return to player.

NORMAL MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> nothing.
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> spawn a 3rd person ghost entity that flies in control of the player (still collides with walls).

______________________________________________

EXTRA:

->allow host persistance between levels ( free and reset the husk near the new player spawn point, OR obliterate the host and "teleport" the "husk" to that origin )
