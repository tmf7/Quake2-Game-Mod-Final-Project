TESTING:

-> mouse1 slighost controls

-> verify rodeo still works ( no hostspeak )

-> why does an order get issued immediatly upon hi? despite latched_buttons ButtonAttack && buttons SHIFT...derp?

-> why wont a follower attack as told?

-> why wont a follower attack a barrell? ( normal rodeo host does just fine )

___________________________
TODO:

-> change soulshiled to a no-model entity with an effect**********

-> limit the follow radius of a follower chasing its owner

-> host_follower may need to be initialized / cleared better

-> tempListener may need to be initialized

-> make it a COMPETITIVE co-op game: you kill eachothers bodies/husks with monsters for FRAGS, first to 20 wins

-> drop the follower when DropHost


-> give drain life a shell in 3rd person ( so its obvious )

-> test co-op for ent visible ( hud stuff, ghost stuff ), and if only the user can see the detect-life lines

-> show player-soul cheat code ( instead of vanishing into the host )

-> fly/swim check for rodeo controls ( and default DropHost )

-> develop proper third person chasecam (note: the client is the human view, the player is the entity being moved around)

--> make installation README ( not a batch )

-> husk holds a weapon (ideally that looks like the players current weapon)...meh ( stuck on super shotgun...but works in coop...WHAT? )
	--> REASONING: the player doesn't have a per-weapon worldmodel in first person

*BUG: soul abilities and collection NOT PERSISTANT between levels (fix that)

*BUG: soul abilities etc not SAVED ( in save.c )

*BUG(1of2): getRidOfWeapon ==> gunindex = 0 still allows firing ( yet newweapon = NULL crashes ) => replace weaponthink qualifiers (ghostmode, hostmode)

*BUG(2of2): if a husk is active between scenes/levels then notarget remains active despite ghostmode deactiveating and husk disappearing
	-> flags get saved into savedFlags in PERSISTANT DATA
	-> solution: actively clear the husk between scenes

*BUG: the player does not appear translucent ( nor does the husk, which is correct ) --> tested in coop SOLUTION: change effect?

*BUG: fix the clip into walls/ceilings when the host dies

BUG: weird angles on detect_life in hover hostmode ( disable, or wait until better chasecam )

BUG: spawnsoul noise randomly repeats until interrupted post-soul-spawn ( even plays over the console dropdown when other sounds dont )

BUG: host PITCH changes too much --> solution: clamp the v_angle OR proper chasecam may resolve the issue

BUG: ducks TOO MUCH/REPEATEDLY ... right into floors if duck, then duck-shoot ( bbox lowerd, then again )
	// specifically write a new duck move (if the monster has the animations )
	// set an array, make a callback to it, declare in possessed.h
	// check if the host is already ducked/standing before performing the move/transition

EXTRA:

->allow host persistance between levels ( free and reset the husk near the new player spawn point, OR obliterate the host and "teleport" the "husk" to that origin )
	--> only when able to warp_husk at higher levels
