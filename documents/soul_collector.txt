TODO:

-> add sounds and hud elements to soul_collector level up ( and soul collection )

-> add cheat code for skipping soul_collector_levels

-> add clientcommands for toggle-able abilities

-> fly/swim check for rodeo controls ( and default DropHost )

-> develop proper third person chasecam (note: the client is the human view, the player is the entity being moved around)

___________________________________________________________
TESTING:

-> husk holds a weapon (ideally that looks like the players current weapon)...meh ( stuck on super shotgun...but works in coop...WHAT? )
	--> REASONING: the player doesn't have a per-weapon worldmodel in first person

BUG: weird sequence of levelup prints despite large gap between level thresholds ( eg: printed level 3, then very next soul printed level 4 )

BUG: the player does not appear translucent ( nor does the husk, which is correct ) --> tested in coop

BUG**: recently killed HOST will have it's deadflag set yet remain alive after spawning its soul ( no secondary soul is spawned )

BUG: fix the clip into walls/ceilings when the host dies

BUG: PITCH changes too much --> solution: clamp the v_angle OR proper chasecam may resolve the issue

BUG: ducks TOO MUCH/REPEATEDLY 

BUG**: continues repeating pain animation? YES, because the currentmove continues until interrupted by given conditions ( despite ANIM_BASIC being set at end of anim )

add a boolean flag for player in "ghost mode"

add a boolean flag for player in "host mode"

add a boolean flag for enemy "possesed" (supplant think commands)

HOST MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> leave inhabited enemy (instead of going to player).
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> explode/gib inhabited enemy.

GHOST MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> inhabit the nearest enemy.
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> return to player.

NORMAL MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> nothing.
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> spawn a 3rd person ghost entity that flies in control of the player (still collides with walls).

______________________________________________

EXTRA:

->allow host persistance between levels ( free and reset the husk near the new player spawn point, OR obliterate the host and "teleport" the "husk" to that origin )
