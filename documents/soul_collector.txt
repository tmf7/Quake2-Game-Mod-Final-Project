TODO:

-> hud elements to soul_collector level up ( and soul collection )

-> fly/swim check for rodeo controls ( and default DropHost )

-> develop proper third person chasecam (note: the client is the human view, the player is the entity being moved around)

-> add slighost sounds for recruiting/controlling new monsters ( control a list/group, re-purpose other binds if in hostmode, add hud help )
	--> 'help' gathers all nearby monsters to fight the HOST's current enemy ( or just gathers them to near the host if no enemy )

-> display different information in soulabilities hud popup depending on ghostmode, hostmode, none

-> do husk armor (orbit max_items num reduced by damage, regen over time )

--> make an INSTALLATION batch file ( copy FROM the batch's current folder itself TO the steam folder )

-> husk holds a weapon (ideally that looks like the players current weapon)...meh ( stuck on super shotgun...but works in coop...WHAT? )
	--> REASONING: the player doesn't have a per-weapon worldmodel in first person

BUG: soul collection amt/name strings not in horizontal alignment

*BUG: soul abilities, etc NOT PERSISTANT between levels (fix that)

*BUG(1of2): getRidOfWeaon ==> gunindex = 0 still allows firing ( yet newweapon = NULL crashes ) => replace weaponthink qualifiers (ghostmode, hostmode)

*BUG(2of2): if a husk is active between scenes/levels then notarget remains active despite ghostmode deactiveating and husk disappearing
	-> flags get saved into savedFlags in PERSISTANT DATA
	-> solution: actively clear the husk between scenes

*BUG: the player does not appear translucent ( nor does the husk, which is correct ) --> tested in coop SOLUTION: change effect?

*BUG: fix the clip into walls/ceilings when the host dies

BUG: weird angles on detect_life in hover hostmode ( disable, or wait until better chasecam )

BUG: not all soldier souls make a sound when picked up ??? ( because they get freed before their sound pointer is used? )

BUG: spawnsoul noise randomly repeats until interrupted post-soul-spawn ( even plays over the console dropdown when other sounds dont )

BUG: host PITCH changes too much --> solution: clamp the v_angle OR proper chasecam may resolve the issue

BUG: ducks TOO MUCH/REPEATEDLY ... right into floors if duck, then duck-shoot ( bbox lowerd, then again )
	// specifically write a new duck move (if the monster has the animations )
	// set an array, make a callback to it, declare in possessed.h
	// check if the host is already ducked/standing before performing the move/transition

add a boolean flag for player in "ghost mode"

add a boolean flag for player in "host mode"

add a boolean flag for enemy "possesed" (supplant think commands)

HOST MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> leave inhabited enemy (instead of going to player).
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> explode/gib inhabited enemy.

GHOST MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> inhabit the nearest enemy.
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> return to player.

NORMAL MODE key-binds:
"inhabit" [ eg 'r' ] -> nothing.
"ghost" [ eg 'f' ]   -> spawn a 3rd person ghost entity that flies in control of the player (still collides with walls).

"uberhost" [ eg 'v' ] -> toggle between uberhost and rodeo host controls
___________________________________________________________

f = "ghost"
r = "inhabit"
v = "uberhost" & "drain_life"
y = "rip_souls"

o = ***unbound***
n = "detect_life"
m = "ghost_fly"

F7 = "soul_abilities"
F8 = "soul_collection"

cheatcode: soullevel [1-5] ( default displays usage )

______________________________________________

EXTRA:

->allow host persistance between levels ( free and reset the husk near the new player spawn point, OR obliterate the host and "teleport" the "husk" to that origin )
	--> only when able to warp_husk at higher levels
