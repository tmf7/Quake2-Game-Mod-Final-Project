what determines ANYTHING's visibility to client's ( players )?

gi.linkentity puts it for interaction in the world, and must by default DRAW it for
everything also linked to that world?

unicast/multicast determines who-all client(s) see an effect ( re: inventory draw )
but it seems to be limited to specific types of pre-defined parameters ( not whole, real entities )


svc_packetentities
centity_t


	centity_t	*ent;
	entity_state_t	*state;

	ent = &cl_entities[newnum];
	ent->serverframe = cl.frame.serverframe;	// if not current, this ent isn't in the frame
