These files list all the behavioral options and associated monster animations for each monster.

Control will be surrendered for death

Control will surrender for pain animations also, unless attack takes anim_priority ( like the player does )

The aifunc calls may be fully ignored in favor of monster_possessed_think behavior

The thinkfunc will most likely remain intact as they say when a muzzle flash/sound/fire/jump tangibly occurs mid-animation

Further study of these aifunc/thinkfunc calls is needed
